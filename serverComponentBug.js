In Next.js 15, a relatively uncommon error arises when using server components with dynamic imports within a function that's also used for both client and server rendering.  The issue manifests when the dynamic import attempts to resolve a module that's only available on the server, causing a runtime error on the client.  This is different from the usual `Next.js server component error` because it's specifically related to the timing and context of dynamic imports within a dual-purpose function.
